# Expedia-Airfare-Prediction

Project Overview:
Predicted base fare prices for airline tickets using Random Forest Regression.
Explored and analyzed the dataset containing various flight and ticket information.
Key Skills Demonstrated:
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and checked for data integrity.
Feature Engineering: Created new features like dayDiff and transformed categorical variables into numerical format.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explored relationships between variables and visualized key insights.
Model Training: Utilized Random Forest Regression and Linear Regression to predict base fares.
Model Evaluation: Calculated R-squared to assess model performance.

Key Insights:
Airports & Base Fare:

Identified OAK as having the highest base fare and BOS with the lowest.
Airlines & Base Fare:

Discovered Southern Airways Express as the most economical and Delta as the most expensive.
Aircraft & Base Fare:

Boeing 737 showed the highest base fare among aircraft types.
Cabin Class & Base Fare:

First class had the highest base fare compared to premium and coach.
Months & Base Fare:

June showed higher base fares, possibly due to vacation season.
November had the lowest base fares, likely due to winter season and holidays.
Day of the Week & Base Fare:

Tuesdays had lower base fares, while Sundays were most expensive.
Refundable Flights:

Noted that refundable flights tended to have higher base fares.
